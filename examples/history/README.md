# Git Historian snapshots (examples)

The `examples/history` folder preserves weekly and on-demand project history
check-ins generated by the Historian tooling.

Each file follows the `YYYY-MM-DD-checkin.md` naming convention and was produced
from `contextledger.cli` using the packaged [`templates/weekly.md`](../../templates/weekly.md)
template. The generator aggregates completed work (merged pull requests and
closed issues), in-progress and backlog items from GitHub Projects, decisions
captured in issue/PR comments, and build artifacts (from GitHub Actions and
optional S3 buckets).

In addition to the human-readable Markdown snapshots, the generator keeps an
updated machine-readable index at [`context-index.json`](context/context-index.json)
so other automation (such as RAG pipelines) can easily discover the latest
check-ins.

See [Git Historian (How to Run)](../git-historian.md) for full usage instructions,
including how to run the generator locally, schedule automated updates, and
customize the output.
